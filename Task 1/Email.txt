Dear Sprocket Central Pty Ltd,

I have reviewed the datasets provide and identified several data quality issues. Here are the key concerns and recommended actions:

Customer Demographic Dataset:
1. Unusual date of birth (DOB) entry: 1843-12-21.
2. Redundant and irregular values in the "default" column; remove them for data consistency.
3. Inconsistent gender values (abbreviations, spelling errors), and "Unidentified" category abbreviated as "U."
4. Empty cells in the "DOB" and "tenure" columns affecting calculations and analysis.
5. 506 empty cells in the "Job title" column, limiting its effectiveness.
6. 125 empty cells in the "Last name" column, hindering proper analysis.

New Customer List Dataset:
1. Inconsistent state name abbreviations (e.g., "New South Wales" as "NSW").
2. "Unidentified" category in the "gender" column abbreviated as "U."
3. 17 empty cells in the "DOB" column, affecting birth date analysis.
4. 106 empty cells in the "job title" column, limiting its usefulness.
5. Numbers stored as text in "property_valuation" and "postcode" columns, causing formatting issues.
6. Five columns without headings, leading to confusion.

Transactions Dataset:
1. 360 blank cells in the "online order" column, impacting online order analysis.
2. 197 empty cells in various columns, affecting analysis involving those attributes.

Customer Address Dataset:
1. Inconsistent state name abbreviations (e.g., "New South Wales" as "NSW").

To mitigate these issues:
1. Validate data for accuracy and completeness.
2. Standardize values (e.g., gender, state abbreviations) and correct errors.
3. Fill in missing values through investigation or data enrichment.
4. Properly format numerical values stored as text.
5. Add column headings for clarity.
6. Remove irregular entries in the "default" column, ensuring clear default status representation.

Attached is a data quality framework as a guideline for assessing data quality.
If you have any questions, please contact me. Thank you for your cooperation, and I look forward to enhancing data quality for our company's growth.
